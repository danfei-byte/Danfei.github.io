# Wendy's Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer satisfaction ratings for major fast-food restaurants in the U.S., with a particular focus on Wendy's. The goal is to understand how Wendy's is perceived relative to its competitors, such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Subway. 

Key analysis and insights are outlined as follows:
1. **Comparative Analysis:**
    - Conduct a descriptive statistical analysis, including metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to summarize customer satisfaction levels for each brand.
    - Use visualizations (e.g., boxplots) to display the distribution of ratings, offering a clear comparison of performance across brands.
2. **Correlation and Brand Positioning:** 
    - Generate a correlation matrix to examine how Wendy’s ratings correlate with its competitors’.
    - Perform a correlation hypothesis test to identify statistically significant relationships and provide insights into potential overlaps or distinctions in customer perceptions.
3. **Wendy's Position Relative to Its Strongest Competitor:** 
    - Analyze rating differences between Wendy’s and its strongest competitor (Burger King) to highlight specific areas of competitive advantage or disadvantage.
    - Use quantile analysis to understand the range of differences in customer satisfaction.
    - Conduct a one-sided hypothesis test to determine if Wendy’s mean rating is statistically higher than its competitor’s, supporting data-driven recommendations.
